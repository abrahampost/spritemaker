Made for my Fall 2017 Comp 541: Digital Logic and Design class
Dragging does not work on mobile.

#To Use
To generate hexcodes, press generate hexcodes and then can copy them to your clipboard
If you would like to edit an already made image, clear the textarea, paste in your codes, then press load from textarea

If you have any questions, and or want to do add anything to it (as I'm done with the class I am most likely finished adding things to this)
open an issue or pull request here. Thanks! Hope this helps.
